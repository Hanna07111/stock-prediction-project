# Project Title
Predict stock price using news headline data

## 📌 Overview
- **Objective**: By using news headline data's sentimental analysis and industry labelling, predict NASDAQ 100 closing prices after 10 days
- **Duration**: 2024.05 ~ 2024.07  
- **Individaul/Team**: Team 

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Languages/Frameworks**: Python, Tensorflow
- **Data**: Nasdaq 100 closing price, Reuters news headline data
- **Tools**: Google colaboratory

## 📊 Key Features
- **Sentimental analysis**: Using BERT for deriving sentiment score from headline data
- **Industry Classification**: Using BERT classification for industry labelling
- **Stock price prediction**: Using LSTM to predict stock price with sentiment score and industry labelling of news headline data
- **Results/Findings**: We found that it is better to use the sentiment score and industry labelling together to predict stock price than using only the sentiment score. The accuracy was about 74.7%
